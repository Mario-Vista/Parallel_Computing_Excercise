# Parallel Computing Exercises with OpenMP in C

Welcome to the repository of exercises for university-level parallel computing using the OpenMP library in the C programming language. This repository contains a collection of exercises designed to help you understand and practice parallel computing using OpenMP, a popular library for parallel programming on multiprocessor architectures.

## Description

The exercises in this repository are specifically tailored to enhance your understanding of parallel computing concepts and techniques using OpenMP. Each exercise focuses on a specific aspect of parallelization, allowing you to explore different strategies and optimize your code for improved performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Mario-Vista/Parallel_Computing_Excercise.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. OpenMP is supported by most modern compilers, including GCC and Clang.

3. Navigate to the exercise directory of your choice and open the corresponding source code file.

4. Read the exercise description and instructions provided in the source code comments.

5. Implement your solution to the exercise following the guidelines and hints given.

6. Compile the code using the appropriate compiler flags to enable OpenMP support. For example, with GCC, you can use the `-fopenmp` flag:
   ```
   gcc -fopenmp exercise.c -o exercise
   ```

7. Execute the compiled program to observe the results of your parallelized code.

8. Analyze and evaluate the performance improvements achieved through parallelization. Experiment with different configurations and approaches to deepen your understanding.

9. Repeat the process for other exercises in the repository, exploring various parallel computing concepts and techniques.
